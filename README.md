# Madison Community Slack - Code of Conduct

## Our Pledge

In the interest of fostering an open, welcoming, and inclusive environment, we as members, contributors, and administrators of the Madison Community Slack pledge to make participation in our community a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body size, disability, ethnicity, sex characteristics, gender identity and expression, level of experience, education, socio-economic status, nationality, personal appearance, race, religion, or sexual identity and orientation.

We aim to create a space where everyone feels comfortable sharing ideas, asking questions, and connecting with fellow members of the Madison community.

## Our Standards

Examples of behavior that contributes to creating a positive environment include:

* **Be Welcoming and Inclusive:** Actively welcome new members and ensure everyone feels valued.
* **Be Respectful:** Treat all members with courtesy and respect. Disagreements may happen, but maintain a civil tone.
* **Be Considerate:** Think about how your contributions will affect others. Jokes that may seem harmless to you could be offensive to others.
* **Be Collaborative:** Encourage and support one another. Share knowledge and help others learn.
* **Assume Good Intent:** Interpret others' statements and actions generously. If unclear, ask for clarification rather than jumping to negative conclusions.
* **Use Clear and Kind Language:** Avoid sarcasm that could be misinterpreted in a text-based medium.
* **Respect Differences of Opinion:** Healthy debate is encouraged, but personal attacks are not.
* **Stay On-Topic in Channels:** Use appropriate channels for your discussions. If unsure, ask in a general channel.
* **Respect Privacy:** Do not share private conversations or personal information about other members without their explicit consent.

## Unacceptable Behavior

The following behaviors are considered harassment and are unacceptable within our community:

* **Unsolicited Direct Messages:** Messages that come from nowhere to other users of the Slack are frowned upon.
* **Spamming and Trolling:** Repeatedly posting off-topic messages, advertisements (unless in #shameless-plugs), or intentionally disruptive content.
* **Soliciting or Promoting Illicit or Deceptive Activities:** Attempting to encourage or recruit members to perform illegal, unethical, or deceptive activities. This includes, but is not limited to, proposals such as impersonating an employee for another individual or company, installing software (like VPNs) for deceptive purposes to mislead organizations, or engaging in fraudulent schemes.
* **Incitement of Unacceptable Behavior:** Advocating for, or encouraging, any of the above behavior.
* **Harassment:** Offensive comments related to gender, gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, disability, mental illness, neuro(a)typicality, physical appearance, body size, age, race, or religion. This also includes unwelcome comments regarding a personâ€™s lifestyle choices and practices, including those related to food, health, parenting, drugs, and employment.
* **Discrimination:** Any form of discrimination based on the characteristics listed above.
* **Hate Speech and Threats:** Using violent or hateful language, or making threats of any kind.
* **Sexual Harassment:** Unwelcome sexual attention or advances, including sharing sexually explicit material without consent or context.
* **Bullying and Intimidation:** Deliberate intimidation, stalking, following, or any behavior intended to make someone feel uncomfortable or unsafe.
* **Spamming and Unsolicited Promotion:** Repeatedly posting off-topic messages or advertisements (unless in a designated channel, if applicable). This explicitly includes sending unsolicited direct messages to offer products or services without prior consent or clear indication of interest from the recipient.
* **Trolling:** Intentionally disruptive or provocative content designed to elicit negative responses.
* **Doxing:** Publishing someone's private information, such as a physical or email address, without their explicit permission.
* **Disruptive Behavior:** Sustained disruption of conversations, talks, or other events.

## Reporting Violations

If you witness or experience unacceptable behavior, or have any other concerns, please contact the community administrators. You can do this by either posting in the #admin channel or reaching out directly to the admins.

All reports will be handled with discretion and investigated thoroughly. We are committed to ensuring the safety and comfort of our community members.

## Enforcement

Administrators will respond to any Code of Conduct violation. Responses may include, but are not limited to:

* **A Warning:** A private or public warning to the individual(s) involved.
* **Permanent Ban:** Permanently removing the individual from the Slack community.

The severity and type of consequence will be determined by the administrators based on the nature and impact of the violation. We will strive for fairness and transparency in all enforcement actions.

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies to all spaces within the Madison Community Slack. It may also apply to public spaces when an individual is representing the community or its members.
